        <h4 class="margintop30"> How is your plan funded?
        </h4>
        <p>When you have your plan review the planner or LAC would have asked you how you wish to manage the plan
            finances. Plan finances is how your providers will be paid. There are three choices â€“ NDIA, self-managed,
            plan managed. Some Categories in your
            plan can be financially managed by more than one method. Why does the funding method matter? If your plan is
            self-managed or managed by a plan manager, you do not have to use a NDIA registered provider. This gives you
            more options to choose
            providers.
